# Introduction
The purpose of this file is to do some initial exploratory analysis of the diamonds data set. This data set is provided in the ggplot2 package.

# EDA
## First Look
A sample, summary, and first glimpse of the diamonds data set is provided below:
```{r}
# Saving the diamonds data as an object: data
data <- ggplot2::diamonds

# Showing a sample
head(data)

# Showing a statistical summary
summary(data)

# Showing the structure of the data
glimpse(data)
```
There are `r nrow(data)` rows of data. Each row is one observation / one diamond. There are `r ncol(data)` columns of data. Each column is a variable / feature. The features are:
```{r}
# Showing column names
names(data)
```



# Conclusion
